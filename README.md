# hwsw

A fork of Champsim - https://github.com/ChampSim/ChampSim

This allows us to run traces in ChampSim and follow arbitrary code information (control flow graphs, def-use chains, loop information, call stack, etc) as we do it, which can be useful in microarchitectural predictors (prefetchers, cache replacement, etc).
